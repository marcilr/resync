+++ Mon 24 Jan 2022 04:14:37 PM AKST - GitHub lists repo URLs with 
a colon rathan than a slash required for checkout.  

For example:
  git@github.com:marcilr/cariloha-bamboo.git

Rather than:
  git@github.com/marcilr/cariloha-bamboo.git

It would be great if the resync checkout script handled the conversion
of the semicolon to slash automatedly.

$ grep -ni src resync 
145:            src = manifest_list[0]
149:            if src == "username":
150:                debug("loop_over_manifest() %s = %s " % (src, tar))
151:                username = src
154:                debug("loop_over_manifest() %s = *** " % src)
158:                new = [src,tar]
204:        src = repo[0]
207:        debug("process_manifest() src repo: %s" % src)
252:            debug("  git clone %s %s" % (src, tar));
262:            call([git, "clone", src, tar])
$

The change would be made after the src variable assignment on line 204.
