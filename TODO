+++ Mon 24 Jan 2022 04:14:37 PM AKST - GitHub lists repo URLs with 
a colon rathan than a slash required for checkout.  

For example:
  git@github.com:marcilr/cariloha-bamboo.git

Rather than:
  git@github.com/marcilr/cariloha-bamboo.git

It would be great if the resync checkout script handled the conversion
of the semicolon to slash automatedly.


+++ Thu, Nov 29, 2018  7:47:43 AM - Add recursive support to resync.
i.e. Support sub-manifest files.

+++ Tue Jan 19 08:17:23 AKST 2016 - Support comma separate user and pass
at end of each manifest line to specify credentials for specified git repo.

+++ Tue Jan 19 08:17:23 AKST 2016 - Add parsing for - and -- command line
arguments.
